/**
 * Lab 7 (part II) - Stairs
 * <p>
 * Recursively construct a stairway, which is made up of
 * rectangles, surrounded by recursively smaller rectantles,
 * approximating a triangle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *    Class Structure:
 *    <ul>
 *	<li>StairController is the controller class, that instantiates
 *	    a complex stairway and moves it in response to mouse events.</li>
 *	<li>StairsInterface is the interface for all stairways (simple or complex.</li>
 *	<li>VariegatedStairs recusrively creates and moves a complex structure
 *	    made out of many nested sub-triangles.</li>
 *	<li>EmptyStairs is the null class that ends the recursive creation
 *	    and moving.  It draws nothing, and has nothing to move.</li>
 *    </ul>
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * Suggested window size: 400x400
